I/O is the problem. 
Data base query is problem 
because every thing is waiting for 
database to response . Database could be in America etc.

We cannot wait for database to response. 
Millions of clock cycles for  TCP / connection. 
in case of database. etc. 

in the mean time we can have other things running. instead
of waiting for a response. 

example. 
Apache vs Nginx

Nginx responds faster then Apache
Concurency * memory. 

vertical axis you have memory and vertical axis you have 
connections.
Apache uses lot of memory when you have thousands of 
clients. 

Apache uses threads for each connection. 
Nginx uses event loops. 


Apache context swithing is not free it costs CPU time
Apache execution stack takes up memory. 
For a massive concurrency cannot use an OS threads
for each connection. 

The right way of concurrency is to have single thread
and have an event loop.
